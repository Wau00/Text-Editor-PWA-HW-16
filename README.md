## Description

In this project, we build a text editor that runs in the browser and implementes methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. Additionally, features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline and meets the PWA criteria.This application back-end was build with node.js, and multiple npm packages. The deployed app is hosted using Heroku Technology
